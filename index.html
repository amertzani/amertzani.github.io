        This workshop connects with several ACSOS main track themes, but also offers a distinctive and complementary forum for research on sustainability, scalability and self- organisation, particularly in relation to the operationalisation of Socio-Technical Sys- tems and issues of public interest, polycentricity, collective action and societal impact. These contrasting themes of inter-related research are as follows:
        <br/>
        • Sustainability of Self-Organisation & Self-Organisation for Sustainability: A drift from decentralised to centralised governance has often been observed in socio- technical systems to address the problem of sustainability. Given the myriad of known and unknown parameters and the spectrum of complexity and dynamics, we see that both centralised and decentralised governance has its advantages and disadvantages, but it is possible, with some introspection and (restricted) freedom for self-modification, to drift or shift between the two. The critical requirements are the ability to shift along the spectrum between the two as circumstances re- quire, the ability to shift back and not get stuck in either of the two extreme attractors, and the ability to make, recognise, and correct mistakes. Trial and error in self-adaptive cybernetic systems is the essence of certain sustainability problems when there is no expertise to solve the problem, so a community must learn to self-organise on the fly. Unfortunately, with one- shot wicked problems such as sustainability, the consequences of error are potentially catastrophic.
        <br/>
        • Scalability of Self-Organisation & Self-Organisation for Scalability: As the size and longevity of an organisation increases or decreases, absolute centralisation brings certain disadvantages: for example it can undermine principles of self- determination, rights to self-organise, and willingness to take responsibility of initiative. This removes ‘edge’ benefits such as localisation, rapid and appropri- ate response to local environmental conditions, and the diversity that promotes resilience. Certain processes that might have been effective at small scale (like word-of-mouth, and monitoring (compliance checking)) are no longer effective at larger scales. On the other hand, from a complex systems perspective, decen- tralisation may make it more difficult, or more lengthy, to coordinate in order to achieve macro-level outcomes, i.e. the coordination of micro-level behaviour through meso-level mechanisms which result in the creation of global structures or achievement of high-level goals by intention or design.

          The first event focuses on recognising achievements of women in our department and those that support them. 
          <br/><br/>
          Each panelist will first present their own technical work, the work of another woman in the department, and/or their personal stories. This is followed by a live Q&A from the host and audience. Here are our panelists in alphabetical order.

            <p>
              After working in R&D in industry, Dafni joined our department to study machine learning and computer vision. Her main research topic is imitation learning in human-centric environments that involve object manipulation. During her time at Imperial, she has also taught STEM students and given a talk to secondary school students about a career in engineering. These experiences highlighted some of the difficulties students, and particularly women, face when pursuing a career in engineering.

          <p>The aim of the second event is to facilitate a conversation on the current role and future perspectives for Women in STEM. We hope to achieve that via a roundtable discussion with four guest speakers from diverse fields and unique professional experiences. The panel will last up to 90 minutes and will be followed by a cocktail reception and a chance to interact with the speakers.
